This is an attempt to create a Securifi integration for Home Assistant.  

Ths first priority are switches as it is the most applicable to my own use case.

# TODOs
# DONE - unique id 
# DONE - enable polling to keep states up-to-date (per entity)
# DONE - adopt async APIs
# DONE - enable group polling
# DONE - Enable web UI configuration
# create API supporting library
# fix switch debouncing (race condition b/w turn_on/off and is_on)
# Add icons and graphics (https://github.com/home-assistant/brands)
# backwards compatibility in switch.py (support async_setup_platform and async_setup_entry)
